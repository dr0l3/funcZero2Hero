On thing to note here is haskells choice to define a string as a list of chars.
Clearly scalas syntax is considerably different than the ML family of both haskell and purescript.
Point free style has been used as much as possible in the haskell part. But not in the purescipt part despite the fact that it seems to support it.
Scala due to not being curried by default does not support this. At least not "out of the box".
